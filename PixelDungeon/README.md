# Pixel Kit

This repository is my game-making workshop playground. You won't find any popular framework stuff inside. Only vanilla JS and some basic canvas manipulation. It's all've been done by group effort by all the people present on this workshop/course.

All the graphics and audio files in `assets` directory come from the awesome [watabou/pixel-dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon). I included the original license there.

**DISCLAIMER:** The original game is available here: http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru/. It is addictive and frustrating. I love it and I'm a huge fan of it :smile:
