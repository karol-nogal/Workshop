# Pixel Kit

This repository shows the workshop "Create your own Pixe Dungeon Game " by InfoshaAcademy crew , and the group progress . 
It was created only in vanilla JavaScript and canvas manipulations . 

All the graphics and audio files in `assets` directory come from the awesome [watabou/pixel-dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon). I included the original license there.

**DISCLAIMER:** The original game is available here: http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru/. It is addictive and frustrating. I love it and I'm a huge fan of it :smile:
